# Data_Crawling
Crawling specific data from SNPedia

SNPedia is a wiki investigating human genetics. They share information about the effects of variations in DNA.
Through this code, I web crawled the data for Position of a Gene, Chromosome no., Geno sequences and their corresponding summaries.

You have to input a csv file containing RsIDs so that the algo could fetch data for the given SNP ID.
